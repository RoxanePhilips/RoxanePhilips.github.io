I'm a doctoral researcher in Psychology at the University of Luxembourg under the supervision of Prof. [Claus VÃ¶gele](https://humanities.uni.lu/directory/claus-vogele). In the context of my thesis I use behavioral, psychophysiological and neural methods to study the role of anticipated affect in decision-making.
