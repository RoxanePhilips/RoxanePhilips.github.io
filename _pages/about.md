I'm a doctoral researcher in Psychology at the University of Luxembourg under the supervision of Prof. [Claus VÃ¶gele](https://humanities.uni.lu/directory/claus-vogele). In the context of my thesis I use behavioral, psychophysiological and neural methods to study the role of anticipated affect in decision-making. I completed my MSc at the KU Leuven in Belgium, where I worked in the field of health psychology and visual cognition. 

##### Research interests
